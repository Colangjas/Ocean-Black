	<h3>Ocean Black Studio History<img src="images/logo1.png" alt="Logo1"></h3>
	<p>In May 2010 Razvan Pusca, Tradigital Animation graduate of St. Clair College and Erik Matos, University Graduate of Fine Arts decided to tough it out and sacrifice everything for an entire year to make form their own gaming studio. Looking back our team we have managed to produce high quality work from the start. The equipment and location didn't matter, it was the core team's drive and determination to meticulously polish every project that was produced.</p>
	<img class="gal" src="images/studiobanner.jpg" alt="Studio Image" /><p>As our studio grew the team's philosophy never strayed. The attention to detail and quality of work stayed paramount. The production of the first video game "G.O.R.K." was the perfect way to finish the first year and gave the inspiration to focus on future projects. Later as the studio was evolving it started getting attention from other animators, artists, and programmers. One of which was a fellow Tradigital Animation graduate of St. Clair College, Colin Thompson. Colin also had training in basic programming and web design which helped the studio gain a better web presence.
	</p><p>From 2011-2013 we have worked with other local teams to produce video games, animations, and has experiment with 3D graphics and video editing to produce short animations showcasing the power of digital art.</p>
	<p>Now in 2014 our team at Ocean Black Studio is determined to continue working on our upcoming projects. We hope to share them very soon with the public.</p>
